Install Ubuntu 20.04[Desktop]

i thought it was easy but it needs good specifications to run smooth, i have faced different problems like auto restart, lag,etc.... and then i deleted ubuntu and 
i intalled it again after ubdating my ram with 8gb and it took aprox 2hrs to research and i have read many blogs to install it......
